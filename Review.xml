</unlicensed-assistive-personal>

<blood-transfusion>
Nurse must remain with the client for the first [blr]15[/blr]-[blr]30[/blr] min.
Transfusion reactions are most likely to occur with the infusion of the first [blr]50[/blr] mL of blood. 
Transfusion is needed when: [blr]platelets[/blr] are low enough to cause [blr]spontaneous bleeding[/blr], severe [blr]anemia[/blr] reduces the amount of [blr]oxygen[/blr] available.

Precautions implemented should be [blr]droplet[/blr] and [blr]airborne[/blr]. 
Avoid contact [blr]4[/blr] days before and [blr]4[/blr] days after rash onset. 
If parents are not vaccinated, they should [blr]not visit[/blr], if they are they can [blr]stay in the room[/blr] and should wear a [blr]regular shurgical mask[/blr]. 
People at high risk for severe illness are [blr]young children[/blr] (less than [blr]5[/blr] years old), adults (greater than [blr]20[/blr] years old), [blr]pregnant women[/blr] and [blr]immunocompromised[/blr].

Primary example is [blr]lidocaine[/blr], other examples are [blr]anticonvulsants[/blr]. 
[blr]Acetaminophen[/blr] is not a co-analgesic. 
</co-analgesic>

<freud-development-theory>
Use a mnemonic - [blr]Old Age Pensioners Love Grapes[/blr]. 
[blr]Oral[/blr] - [blr]birth[/blr] to [blr]1[/blr] - fixated on [blr]thumb sucking[/blr] - later in life are [blr]nail biters[/blr] and [blr]smokers[/blr]. 
[blr]Anal[/blr] - [blr]1[/blr] to [blr]3[/blr] - pleasure from [blr]defication[/blr] - by this time [blr]ego[/blr] has developed - if [blr]potty training[/blr] is harsh people become [blr]tidy[/blr], [blr]punctual[/blr] and [blr]respectful of authority[/blr]. The opposite traits if [blr]potty training[/blr] is not restrictive. 
[blr]Phallic[/blr] - [blr]3[/blr] to [blr]6[/blr] - children become aware of [blr]gender differencesa[/blr] - leads to [blr]Oedipus complex[/blr] in boys and [blr]Electra Complex[/blr] in girls. In Oedipus complex boy wants to [blr]posess his mother[/blr] exclusively and [blr]get rid of father[/blr] - boy develops [blr]castration anxiety[/blr] - conflict is resolved by [blr]imitating father[/blr], through a process called [blr]identification[/blr] - where the boy internally adopts [blr]values[/blr], [blr]attitudes[/blr] and [blr]behaviours[/blr] of [blr]another person[/blr]. Electra complex - girl [blr]desires her father[/blr] but realizes she [blr]does not have a penis[/blr]. This leads to [blr]penis envy[/blr] where she wishes she [blr]was a boy[/blr]. The girl resolves this by [blr]repressing[/blr] the desire for her father and [blr]penis envy[/blr] turns into a [blr]wish to have a baby[/blr]. 
[blr]Latent[/blr] - [blr]6[/blr] to [blr]puberty[/blr] - [blr]libido[/blr] is [blr]dormant[/blr]. Most sexual impulses are [blr]repressed[/blr] and sexual energy is [blr]sublimated[/blr] into [blr]schoolwork[/blr]. 
[blr]Genital[/blr] - [blr]puberty[/blr] to [blr]adult[/blr] - [blr]sexual exploration[/blr] with a resolution of [blr]settling down with a loved one[/blr].

[blr]Conjunctive[/blr] Faith - [blr]Mid[/blr] life - develops a [blr]multi dimensional[/blr] view of faith and truth.
