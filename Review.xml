Patient is placed in Trandelenburg position (head down) to contain air emboli in lower chambers and to produce dilation of neck and subclavian veins. 
Subclavian vein is used most of the time. Sometimes basilic, cephalic or as a last resort femoral veins could be used.
Area is swabbed with chlorhexidine to remove any residual oils. 
Patient is asked to turn head away from insertion site to give more tension. 
Lidocaine is injected into tissue to numb the area.
Large bore needle is insertered parallel to the clavicle and guided deeper until it hits the vein.
Patient is asked to take a deep breath and perform the Valsalva manuver, that is bear down, to create a positive pressure phase in central venous pressure and make it harder for air emboli to move in, as the cather is guided through the needle and into the superior vena cava. 
Needle is removed and catheter is sutured to the skin.
Chlorhexidine impregnated gauze with transparent dressing is placed over the insertion site.
Catheter placement is confirmed with an x-ray (as well as to rule out accidental puncture of the pleura and pneumothorax)
