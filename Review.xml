<chronic-kidney-disease>
[important]
Foods to avoid: [blr]citrus[/blr] fruit, they are high in [blr]potassium[/blr] as damaged kidneys cannot remove it. 
Dried [blr]fruits[/blr], [blr]avocado[/blr], [blr]tomato[/blr], [blr]potatoes[/blr] and [blr]bananas[/blr]. 
[blr]Calcium[/blr] is lost through the damaged kidneys.
Dairy products are high in [blr]phosphorus[/blr] which binds even more calcium and should be avoided.
Dietary [blr]protein[/blr] incrases uric acid (urea) production which cannot be cleared by the damaged kidneys. Dietary protein should be kept at low or normal levels (but not incrased).
Elevated  [blr]potassium [/blr] and low  [blr]hemoglobin [/blr] are expected. 
Common symptoms are [blr]anemia[/blr] (low [blr]hemoglobin[/blr]), [blr]hypocalcemia[/blr], metabolic [blr]acidosis[/blr].
Anemia is related to the kidney's inaility to secrete [blr]erythropoietin[/blr] ([blr]EPO[/blr]). 
Hypocalcemia is linked to the inabilty of the kidneys to [blr]recycle vitamin D[/blr]. 
Acidosis is consistent because of the kidney's inability to regulate [blr]sodium bicarbonate[/blr].  
 [blr]Constipation [/blr] is common due to  [blr]phosphate binders [/blr] such as  [blr]sevelamer [/blr], and kidney disease itself. 
Diet needs to be low in [blr]protein[/blr], [blr]sodium[/blr], [blr]potassium[/blr] and [blr]phosphorus[/blr].

[blr]Lactulose[/blr] could be administered to decrease ammonia by causing increase in [blr]bowel movements[/blr]. 
Correcting [blr]hypokalemia[/blr] also leads to reduction of ammonia levels (accumulation of which increases with [blr]low potassium[/blr]).
</liver-disease>

<pediatric-adult-differences>
Pediatric patients have a [blr]larger[/blr] proportion of surface area to body size than adults. This affects how [blr]fast[/blr] medications [blr]absorbed[/blr] through the skin take to get to [blr]systemic ciruclation[/blr]. 
Pediatric patients have a [blr]larger head[/blr] in proportion to body length. They are born with thier head comprising [blr]25[/blr]% of their body length, this proportion lessens until it's about [blr]12[/blr]% of thier overall body height at around 10 years of age. 
Pediatric patients have an immature [blr]blood-brain-barrier[/blr], so are more at risk of drugs affecting their [blr]CNS[/blr]. 
Pediatric patients do not have [blr]enlarged airway passages[/blr] compared to adults, they have [blr]smaller airwayas[/blr] and immature [blr]lungs[/blr]. This leads children to be more succeptible to [blr]respiratory illnesses[/blr] and viruses such as [blr]asthma[/blr], [blr]respiratory syncytial[/blr] virus, and [blr]bronchitis[/blr]. 
</pediatric-adult-differences>

<nursing-interventions>
Classified as [blr]dependent[/blr] nursing interventions, [blr]independent[/blr] nursing interventions, and [blr]collaborative[/blr] interventions. 
Independent nursing interventions are actions that could be [blr]initiated[/blr] by the nurse wihtout needing a [blr]prescribed order[/blr] - [blr]monitoring[/blr] skin, [blr]assisting[/blr] the client with tasks, providing [blr]education[/blr]. 
Dependent nursing inteventions inlvolve a [blr]provider's order[/blr] - administering [blr]medications[/blr], starting [blr]input[/blr] and [blr]output[/blr] monitoring etc. 
Collaborative nursing interventions inlvove [blr]another member[/blr] of the [blr]health care te[/blr]am - for example consulting a [blr]psychiatrist[/blr] about the patients drug abuse problem. 
</nursing-interventions>

<histamine>
Causes [blr]itching[/blr] and tissue [blr]swelling[/blr], as well as constricting [blr]bronchial muscles[/blr] and could cause [blr]wheezing[/blr] and [blr]shortness of breath[/blr]. 
</histamine>

<bradykinin>
Causes the [blr]dry cough[/blr] in people taking ACE inhibitors because it decreases [blr]bradykinin breakdown[/blr], since ACE breaks down bradykinin. 
Causes [blr]vasodilation[/blr], [blr]bronchoconstriction[/blr], and [blr]mucus[/blr] buildup. 
</bradykinin>

<skin-grafting>
Do not apply [blr]ice[/blr] post surgery. 
</skin-grafting>

<diphteria>
Caused by bacterium [blr]Corynebacterium diphtheriae[/blr].
Before vaccines was the [blr]leading cause of death[/blr] in [blr]children[/blr] around the world including United States. 
Spread by [blr]respiratory droplets[/blr] and through [blr]touching infected sores[/blr]. 
Could cause infections of the [blr]airways[/blr] or [blr]skin[/blr].
When airways are infected, the [blr]neck swells[/blr] due to [blr]enalrged lymph nodes[/blr], mild [blr]fever[/blr] develops along with [blr]sore throat[/blr]. 
Bacteria builds [blr]toxins[/blr] that kills [blr]healthy tissue[/blr] in the airways and forms a [blr]thick pseudomembrane[/blr] of [blr]gray[/blr] color on the [blr]tonsils[/blr] and in the [blr]nose[/blr]. 
If toxin gets into the blood stream could cause infections of the [blr]heart[/blr], as well as [blr]nerve[/blr] and [blr]kidney[/blr] damange. 
If diphtheria affects the skin then it causes [blr]open sores[/blr], however it [blr]rarely results in severe infections[/blr]. 
[blr]Incubation[/blr] period (period between infection and feeling symptoms) is [blr]2[/blr]-[blr]5[/blr] days. 
[blr]Communicable[/blr] period (period when the person can transmit the infection) could last from [blr]2[/blr] to [blr]4[/blr] weeks, but with antibiotics can be reduced to [blr]48[/blr] hours after starting treatment. 
Even with treatment, mortality rate still remains high at [blr]10[/blr]%. 
</diphteria>

<hypoglycemia>
Exercise or consumption of [blr]alcohol[/blr] caould cause [blr]hypoglycemia[/blr]. 
</hypoglycemia>

<addition-calorie-formula>
 [blr]Middle chain [/blr] tricglycerides ( [blr]MCTs [/blr]) is a type of oil that could be added to formulas to add  [blr]calories [/blr] if needed. 
</addition-calorie-formula>

<adreno-leuko-dystrophy>
Causes a buildup of  [blr]very long chain fatty acids [/blr] ( [blr]VLCFA [/blr]).

Treatment is with  [blr]Lorenzo's oil [/blr] (a combination of  [blr]oleic [/blr] and  [blr]erucic [/blr] oils), as well as  [blr]stem cell transplant [/blr] in younger patients. 
</adreno-leuko-dystrophy>

<phenylketonuria>
Infant must be placed on a special  [blr]phenylalanine [/blr] free formula, and not be  [blr]breasfed [/blr], becasuse  [blr]breastmilk [/blr] contains phenylalanine.
</phenylketonuria>

<ostomy>
Don't use any  [blr]barrier creams [/blr] or  [blr]powders [/blr] arouind the stoma to not compromise adhesion. 
Get a skin barrier that has a radius of  [blr]one eigth [/blr] of an inch larger than the stoma. 
Empty the pouch frequently, at least  [blr]6 [/blr] times per day. 
Remove the skin barrier by  [blr]pushing the skin away [/blr] from the barrier instead of  [blr]pulling [/blr] the barrier  [blr]away [/blr] from the skin. 
Do not use  [blr]straws [/blr] when drinking as the could cause an increase in  [blr]gas [/blr]. 
Limit foods that cause strong fecal odors and gas such as  [blr]eggs [/blr],  [blr]garlic [/blr],  [blr]beans [/blr],  [blr]carbonated beverages [/blr], and  [blr]cabbage [/blr]. 
When washing the pouch do not use  [blr]soaps [/blr] or  [blr]detergents [/blr], just  [blr]plain warm water [/blr]. 
Types of ostomies:
Ileostomy - indicated for  [blr]ulcerative colitis [/blr] and  [blr]Crohns [/blr] disease.  [blr]Liquid [/blr] stool with  [blr]no ability to regulate [/blr] stool. Requires constant wearing of  [blr]pouches [/blr]. 
Ascending and Transverse colostomies  - indicated for perforated  [blr]diverticulum [/blr].  [blr]Semi-formed [/blr] stool with  [blr]no ability to regulate [/blr] output, requires constant application of  [blr]appliances [/blr]. 
Sigmoid colostomy -  [blr]formed [/blr] stool,  [blr]some control [/blr] of the output by  [blr]irrigation [/blr] and  [blr]bowel regiment [/blr]. Client may not require a  [blr]skin barrier [/blr] or a  [blr]pouch [/blr] with proper  [blr]bowel regiment [/blr]. 
</ostomy>

<blood-pressure-measureming>
Inflate the cuff  [blr]30 [/blr] mmHg above the level where  [blr]radial [/blr] pulse is no longer palpable. 
Repeating assessments too quickly could cause a falsely  [blr]high systolic [/blr] measurement. 
Positiong the brachial artery below the hart can cause a falsely  [blr]high [/blr] blood preassure measurement. 
Deflating the cuff too quickly can cause a  [blr]high diastolic [/blr] measurement. 
</blood-pressure-measureming>

<intra-cranial-pressure>
Normal pressure is usually less than  [blr]20 [/blr] mmHg. 
Early sign of elevation of pressure could be  [blr]agitation [/blr],  [blr]restlessness [/blr], and  [blr]combativeness [/blr].
Next sign is agitation progresses to  [blr]lethargy [/blr]. 
Changes in  [blr]vital signs [/blr] associated with the Cushing's triad is a  [blr]late [/blr] sign and is indicative of  [blr]brainstem compression [/blr]. 
Pupils become  [blr]fixed [/blr] and  [blr]unresponsive to light [/blr] with increased ICP. 
 [blr]Systolic [/blr] hypertension with  [blr]widening [/blr] pulse pressure (normal pulse pressure is  [blr]40 [/blr]- [blr]60 [/blr] mmHg) is a componant of the  [blr]Cushing triad [/blr], which is a  [blr]late indication [/blr] of increased ICP. Additional components of the cushing triad are  [blr]bradycardia [/blr] and  [blr]irregular respirations [/blr]. 
At high pressures cerebral blood flow is  [blr]decreased [/blr] and  [blr]herniation [/blr] of the brain oculd occur. 
To prevent an increase in ICP:
Maintain the head of bed at  [blr]30 [/blr]- [blr]45 [/blr] degrees. 
Do not  [blr]twist head [/blr] to maintain proper venous drainage. 
Avoid  [blr]coughing [/blr] or  [blr]gagging [/blr] as that could increase the ICP. 
Avoid the  [blr]valsalva [/blr] manuver. 
Based on the  [blr]Monroe-Kellie [/blr] doctorine,  [blr]CSF [/blr] and  [blr]blood volumes [/blr] and  [blr]brain tissue [/blr] volme are fixed, so an increase in one causes a  [blr]decrease [/blr] in the others. 
Cerebral perfusion pressure is used to estimate cerebral perfusion, in adults should be  [blr]60 [/blr]- [blr]70 [/blr] mmHg. CPP =  [blr]MAP - ICP [/blr]
Hypercarbia (excessive  [blr]CO2 [/blr] in the blood) could cause  [blr]cerbral vessel dilation [/blr] and an increse in cerebral blood flow. 
Management of increase ICP includes:
Patient could be asked to  [blr]hyperventilate [/blr] to temporarily lower the  [blr]CO2 [/blr]. 
Administration of an  [blr]osmotic diuretic [/blr] or a  [blr]hypertonic saline [/blr] solution to decrease cerebral  [blr]edema [/blr].
Placing the client in a  [blr]coma [/blr] can decrease the  [blr]metabolic [/blr] requirements of the brain. 
 [blr]Craniectomy [/blr] could be done as a last resort to allow the brain to  [blr]swell [/blr] without  [blr]compression [/blr]. 
</intra-cranial-pressure>

<graft>
Do not cover with a  [blr]blanket [/blr] as friction could disrupt the graft. 
 [blr]Elevation [/blr] and  [blr]immobilization [/blr] is the best course of action for  [blr]lower extremity [/blr] grafts. This position should be maintained for  [blr]3 [/blr]- [blr]7 [/blr] days. 
Greatest risks are  [blr]infection [/blr] and  [blr]graft rejection [/blr]. 
Graft material is usually  [blr]stapled [/blr] over the wound. 
</graft>

<hypoxemia>
Results in  [blr]anaerobic metabolism [/blr] to be performed by the cells which produces  [blr]lactic acid [/blr]. 
Lactic acid is balanced by  [blr]sodium bicarbonate [/blr]. When  [blr]sodium bicarbonate [/blr] can't be produced in sufficient quantities to buffer the pH lowering effects of the acid,  [blr]metabolic acidosis [/blr] sets in. 
</hypoxemia>

<child-abuse>
If suspected, should report to the  [blr]supervisor [/blr]. 
Types of abuse:  [blr]neglect [/blr],  [blr]physical [/blr],  [blr]emotion [/blr],  [blr]sexual [/blr]. 
 [blr]Disabled [/blr] children at highest risk for abuse. 
Majority of cases involve  [blr]neglect [/blr], not physical abuse.  [blr]Emotion [/blr] abuse is in second place. 
Neglect could be  [blr]intentional [/blr] or  [blr]unintentional [/blr] but  [blr]physical [/blr] abuse is always intentional. 
Spanking or paddling is  [blr]not considered physical [/blr] abuse unless it results bodily injury. 
</child-abuse>

<postpartum-period>
Extra  [blr]fluid [/blr] accumulated during pregnancy could be lost to  [blr]diuresis [/blr]. 
White blood cell counts could  [blr]jump to 30,000 [/blr] per microliter of blood. WBC counts return to normal in about  [blr]1 week [/blr]. 
Due to  [blr]dehydration [/blr] and elevated  [blr]WBC [/blr] counts an elevation of  [blr]temperature [/blr] could also occur, up to  [blr]100.4F [/blr] ( [blr]38C [/blr]).
If elevation of  [blr]temperature [/blr] does not resolve in  [blr]24 hours [/blr] or other symptoms of an  [blr]infection [/blr] develop, then it could be an infection. 
Exmining legs for signs of  [blr]thrombophlebitis [/blr] is important in the  [blr]6 week [/blr] postpartum period.

<drug-pregnancy-categories>
Category A - well controlled human studies failed to show risk to fetus. Example drug: levothyroxine. 
Category B - animal studies have failed to show risk to fetus. No human studies have been done. Example drugs: metformin, amoxicillin, hydrochlorathiazide. 
Category C - Animal studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but there are no adequete studies for humans. Potential benefit might outweight the risk. Example drugs: gabapentin, amlodipine, nicotine gum 
Category D - There is positive evidence on human fetal risk, but benefits might still outweight risks. Example drugs: nicotine transdermal patch.
Category X - Studies have demonstrated fetal abnormalities, risks outweigh benefits. Example drugs: warfarin, simvastatin
</drug-pregnancy-categories>

<drug-effect-by-fetal-age>
Drugs taken before 20th day after fertilization have an all or nothing effect - either they kill the embryo or do not affect it at all. Teratogenesis is unlikely at this stage. 
Drugs taken between 20th and 56th day have the most likely chance of causing teratogenesis - either gross anatomical defects or covert embryopathy which may how up later in life. 
Drugs taken in 2nd and 3rd trimesters are unlikely to cause teratogenesis but may alter the growth and function of organs. 
</drug-effect-by-fetal-age>

<rapid-response-team>

Patient is given an IV sedative along with a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) such as succinylcholine, to reduce the risk of injury. 
During the procedure vital signs are continuously monitiered. Because of NMBA seizure activity cannot be monitored. In order to monitor whether the client is having a seizure, a blood pressure cuff is placed on an arm (or ankle) and inflated above the systolic preassure. This prevents NMBA from getting into the arm with the cuff.
</electro-convulsive-therapy>

Occurs more often with Type II diabetics. 
Because acidosis is not present symptoms may go unnoticed until blood glucose becomes extremely high (600 - 1000 mg/dL).
Blood becomes extremely hyperosmotic due to dehydration, the primary symptom being altered conciousness due to dehydration of brain tissue.

<wound-healing>
Comprised for four stages: 
Stage 1 - hemostasis - blood vessels constrict and platets attach to damaged tissue resulting, fibrin is formed by the coagulation cascade and forms a fibrin clot. 
Stage 2 - inflammation - occurs within 24 hours of injury and could last up to 2 weeks - mast cells release histamine which is responsible for 5 cardinal signs - rubor (redness), calor (heat), tumor (swelling), and dolor (pain). During this stage macrophages and other white blood cells travel to this area to cear out bacteria. 
Stage 3 - proliferation - fibroblast matrix is replaced to provide greater structural integrity to the area and angiogensis occurs to rebuild blood vessels. During this stage granulation tissue forms - it's a network of blood vessels and fibrin. 
Stage 4 - remodelling - granulation tissue transforms into strong scar tissue.

<burns>
Electrolyte and fluid imbalances are corrected based on the periods the patinet is in: 
(1) Initial resuscitation (first 24 hours): 
Due to changes in cellular permeability sodium enters the intracellular compartment, leading to hyponatremia, cellular damage leads to hyperkalemia. 
Due to blood shunting to brain and vital organs kideny function is reduced, leading to reduced urine output.  
Gloal of fluid resucitation is to maintain urinary output at 30-50cc. 
During resucitation, modified Brooke formula or Parkland formula is used to calculate how much fluid to give in the first 24 hours.
Modified Brook's - 2mL x % TBSA burned x weight in kg 
Parkland - 4mL x % TBSA burned x weight in kg 
Half the amount should be given in the first 8 hours, remaining half in the remaining 16 hours. 
Lactated Ringers is the fluid of choice. 
(2) Early post resuscitation period (day 2 - 6):
This phase is characterized by hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia (opposite to initial stage) and hypomagnesemia.
Increased urinary output is seen at this stage (not in the first 24 hours). It may rise to up to 100ml/hour.
D5-0.45-NS (D5-half-NS) is the fluid of choice to decrease hypernatremia. 
Severe hypophosphetemia may appear around day 3 and is most prevalent on day 7. It is not seen a few hours post burn. 
(3) Inflammation and infection period (seen after the first week and lasts until the wounds heal): 
Also known as the hypermetabolic period. 
Nutritional support, rehabilitation, and prevention of infection are the primary goals of this period.

<diuretic-drugs>
Help the body get rid of sodium and water, often used in combination. 
Three classes: thiazide diuretics, potassium sparing diuretics, and loop diuretics. 
Thiazide diuretics: act directly on the kidney by inhibiting sodium-chloride cotransporter in the DCT. This causes a higher concentration of sodium upstream in the collecting duct. Epithelial Sodium and Potassium channels on the principal cells of the collecting duct allow sodium and potassium to diffuse based on concentration gradients. Due to a higher concentration of sodium in the collecting duct, sodium flows into the principal cell and the collecting duct becomes negative, causing potassium to flow out. 
</diuretic-drugs>
